The difference between Component and PureComponent is how they update. Component updates every time it's told, whether things changed or not. PureComponent, on the other hand, checks before updating. It only updates if something actually changed, avoiding unnecessary updates.

In my counter scenario, both do the counting job. But PureComponent is smarter. It doesn't waste time updating when things stay the same. This makes it faster, especially when there's no real change to count. So, PureComponent is more efficient in these situations, only counting when something new happens.
